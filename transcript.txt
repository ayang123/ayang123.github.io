0:01:00	LEHRER: Good evening from the Magness Arena at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado.
0:06:00	I'm Jim Lehrer of the "PBS NewsHour," and I welcome you to the first of the 2012 presidential
0:13:00	debates between President Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, and former Massachusetts
0:19:00	Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee.
0:22:00	LEHRER: This debate and the next three -- two presidential, one vice presidential -- are
0:28:00	sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight's 90 minutes will be about
0:34:00	domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the commission. There will be six roughly
0:42:00	15-minute segments with two-minute answers for the first question, then open discussion
0:48:00	for the remainder of each segment.
0:50:00	Thousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the Internet
0:56:00	and other means, but I made the final selections. And for the record, they were not submitted
1:02:00	for approval to the commission or the candidates.
1:06:00	The segments as I announced in advance will be three on the economy and one each on health
1:13:00	care, the role of government and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences,
1:20:00	specifics and choices. Both candidates will also have two-minute closing statements.
1:27:00	The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent -- no cheers, applause, boos,
1:33:00	hisses, among other noisy distracting things, so we may all concentrate on what the candidates
1:40:00	have to say. There is a noise exception right now, though, as we welcome President Obama
1:50:00	and Governor Romney.
2:00:00	(APPLAUSE)
2:09:00	Gentlemen, welcome to you both. Let's start the economy, segment one, and let's begin
2:25:00	with jobs. What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would
2:34:00	go about creating new jobs?
2:37:00	LEHRER: You have two minutes. Each of you have two minutes to start. A coin toss has
2:42:00	determined, Mr. President, you go first.
2:43:00	OBAMA: Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to thank Governor
2:48:00	Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality.
2:50:00	There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years
2:56:00	ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me.
3:01:00	And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from
3:08:00	now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.
3:11:00	(LAUGHTER)
3:12:00	You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
3:19:00	Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial
3:24:00	system had frozen up.
3:27:00	And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we've begun to fight
3:32:00	our way back. Over the last 30 months, we've seen 5 million jobs in the private sector
3:38:00	created. The auto industry has come roaring back. And housing has begun to rise.
3:45:00	But we all know that we've still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight
3:49:00	is not where we've been, but where we're going.
3:54:00	Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy,
4:00:00	and roll back regulations, that we'll be better off. I've got a different view.
4:05:00	I think we've got to invest in education and training. I think it's important for us to
4:09:00	develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that
4:15:00	we're helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States,
4:19:00	that we take some of the money that we're saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild
4:24:00	America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these
4:29:00	critical investments.
5:02:00	ROMNEY: Now, I'm
6:39:00	concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful. The president has
6:43:00	a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government,
6:48:00	spending more, taxing more, regulating more -- if you will, trickle-down government -- would
6:53:00	work.
6:54:00	That's not the right answer for America. I'll restore the vitality that gets America working
6:59:00	again. Thank you.
7:00:00	LEHRER: Mr. President, please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickle-down
7:05:00	his trick-down approach, as he said yours is.
7:10:00	OBAMA: Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do. First, we've got
7:16:00	to improve our education system and we've made enormous progress drawing on ideas both
7:23:00	from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest
7:28:00	to deal with schools. We've got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms
7:35:00	in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers.
7:38:00	So now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million
7:45:00	more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are
7:49:00	out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.
7:56:00	When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate
8:00:00	is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent.
8:06:00	But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are
8:13:00	shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing
8:17:00	here in the United States.
8:19:00	On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we've got to boost American energy
8:24:00	production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years. But
8:31:00	I also believe that we've got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and
8:35:00	solar and biofuels, and make those investments.
8:38:00	OBAMA: So all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close
8:42:00	our deficit, and one of the things I'm sure we'll be discussing tonight is, how do we
8:46:00	deal with our tax code? And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible
8:52:00	way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments?
8:54:00	And this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls
9:00:00	for a $5 trillion tax cut -- on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another
9:04:00	trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't
9:09:00	asked for. That's $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the
9:15:00	investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans,
9:20:00	I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.
9:23:00	LEHRER: Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things, and we're going to try
9:27:00	to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can.
9:31:00	But, first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that you'd like to ask the president
9:34:00	directly about something he just said?
9:37:00	ROMNEY: Well, sure. I'd like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece.
9:40:00	First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don't have a tax cut of a scale that
9:44:00	you're talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle
9:49:00	class. But I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income
9:54:00	people are doing just fine in this economy. They'll do fine whether you're president or
9:57:00	I am.
9:58:00	The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the
10:02:00	president's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They're just being crushed.
10:07:00	Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a -- this is
10:14:00	a tax in and of itself. I'll call it the economy tax. It's been crushing.
10:18:00	At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up.
10:23:00	Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income
10:29:00	families are being crushed.
10:31:00	ROMNEY: And so the question is how to get them going again. And I've described it. It's
10:34:00	energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping
10:38:00	small business. Those are the -- the cornerstones of my plan.
10:42:00	But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I'll just note. First, education. I
10:46:00	agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs
10:51:00	right now, we've got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight
10:55:00	different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We've got to get those dollars back to the
11:00:00	states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training
11:04:00	they need for jobs that will really help them.
11:07:00	The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both
11:11:00	for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have
11:16:00	the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so
11:21:00	that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.
11:24:00	The third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that
11:29:00	production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his
11:35:00	policies.
11:36:00	Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land,
11:42:00	not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of
11:47:00	permits and licenses in half. If I'm president, I'll double them, and also get the -- the
11:53:00	oil from offshore and Alaska. And I'll bring that pipeline in from Canada.
11:57:00	And, by the way, I like coal. I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal.
12:02:00	People in the coal industry feel like it's getting crushed by your policies. I want to
12:06:00	get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.
12:11:00	And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I'm not looking to cut massive taxes
12:16:00	and to reduce the -- the revenues going to the government. My -- my number-one principal
12:21:00	is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no
12:25:00	tax cut that adds to the deficit.
12:27:00	But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I -- and to
12:33:00	do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any
12:37:00	any language to the contrary is simply not accurate. LEHRER: Mr. President?
12:41:00	OBAMA: Well, I think -- let's talk about taxes, because I think it's instructive. Now, four
12:48:00	years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families.
12:55:00	And that's exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600.
13:02:00	And the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing
13:08:00	well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and
13:14:00	so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather
13:19:00	the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid who's
13:23:00	going off to college, which means they're spending more money, businesses have more
13:27:00	customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.
13:30:00	Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5
13:37:00	trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And
13:43:00	he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem
13:49:00	is that he's been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes,
13:55:00	and he hasn't been able to identify them.
13:57:00	But I'm going to make an important point here, Jim.
13:59:00	LEHRER: All right.
13:59:00	OBAMA: When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can
14:06:00	-- are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don't come close
14:10:00	to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.
14:15:00	OBAMA: And that's why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet
14:20:00	Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the deficit or -- or -- or not adding to the deficit
14:27:00	is by burdening middle-class families. The average middle-class family with children
14:31:00	would pay about $2,000 more.
14:34:00	Now, that's not my analysis. That's the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And
14:38:00	 and that kind of top -- top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so
14:43:00	the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families
14:50:00	are burdened further, that's not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.
14:55:00	LEHRER: All right. What is the difference? Let's just stay on taxes.
14:57:00	(CROSSTALK)
14:58:00	LEHRER: Just -- let's just stay on taxes for (inaudible).
15:01:00	(CROSSTALK)
15:01:00	LEHRER: What is the difference...
15:01:00	ROMNEY: Well, but -- but virtually -- virtually everything he just said about my tax plan
15:04:00	is inaccurate.
15:05:00	LEHRER: All right.
15:06:00	ROMNEY: So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say
15:10:00	absolutely not. I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I've said is I won't put in
15:16:00	place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That's part one. So there's no economist that
15:21:00	can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with
15:26:00	my tax plan.
15:27:00	Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals. I know that you
15:32:00	and your running mate keep saying that and I know it's a popular thing to say with a
15:35:00	lot of people, but it's just not the case. Look, I've got five boys. I'm used to people
15:40:00	saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping
15:44:00	I'll believe it. But that -- that is not the case. All right? I will not reduce the taxes
15:49:00	paid by high-income Americans.
15:52:00	And number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families. I will
15:58:00	lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies
16:02:00	that looked at the study you describe and say it's completely wrong. I saw a study that
16:06:00	came out today that said you're going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income
16:11:00	families.
16:12:00	There are all these studies out there. But let's get at the bottom line. That is, I want
16:16:00	to bring down rates. I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and
16:21:00	exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. And you'd
16:25:00	think, well, then why lower the rates?
16:27:00	ROMNEY: And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America's
16:34:00	workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the
16:39:00	individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people.
16:45:00	For me, this is about jobs. This is about getting jobs for the American people.
16:49:00	(CROSSTALK)
16:49:00	LEHRER: That's where we started. Yeah.
16:50:00	Do you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan?
16:54:00	OBAMA: Well, for 18 months he's been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before
17:00:00	the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is, "Never mind."
17:05:00	And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then
17:13:00	it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect
17:17:00	high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class.
17:25:00	It's -- it's math. It's arithmetic.
17:28:00	Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth.
17:33:00	So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families,
17:41:00	I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue
17:49:00	the tax rates -- the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.
17:55:00	But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates
18:02:00	that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went
18:06:00	from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.
18:10:00	And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit,
18:15:00	we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we're also able to make
18:20:00	the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.
18:24:00	OBAMA: And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business.
18:29:00	Under -- under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes
18:35:00	go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they're the job creators, they'd
18:40:00	be burdened.
18:41:00	But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires
18:46:00	who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump
18:50:00	doesn't like to think of himself as small anything, but -- but that's how you define
18:56:00	small businesses if you're getting business income.
18:58:00	And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way
19:04:00	to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is
19:11:00	to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest
19:19:00	in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow. And I think
19:24:00	that would be a mistake.
19:24:00	LEHRER: All right.
19:25:00	ROMNEY: Jim, let me just come back on that -- on that point, which is these...
19:28:00	LEHRER: Just for the -- just for record...
19:29:00	(CROSSTALK)
19:29:00	ROMNEY: ... the small businesses we're talking about...
19:30:00	LEHRER: Excuse me. Excuse me. Just so everybody understands, we're way over our first 15 minutes.
19:35:00	ROMNEY: It's fun, isn't it?
19:36:00	LEHRER: It's OK, it's great. No problem. Well, you all don't have -- you don't have a problem,
19:39:00	I don't have a problem, because we're still on the economy. We're going to come back to
19:43:00	taxes. I want move on to the deficit and a lot of other things, too.
19:47:00	OK, but go ahead, sir.
19:48:00	ROMNEY: You bet. Well, President, you're -- Mr. President, you're absolutely right, which
19:52:00	is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not -- not taxed at the 35
19:56:00	percent tax rate, they're taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the
20:00:00	last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half -- half of all the people who work in
20:06:00	small business. Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America.
20:11:00	And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.
20:15:00	Now, and -- and I've talked to a guy who has a very small business. He's in the electronics
20:20:00	business in -- in St. Louis. He has four employees. He said he and his son calculated how much
20:24:00	they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales
20:30:00	tax, state property tax, gasoline tax. It added up to well over 50 percent of what they
20:35:00	earned. And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent
20:41:00	to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will
20:46:00	cost 700,000 jobs.
20:49:00	I don't want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the
20:55:00	tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the
21:01:00	way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because
21:06:00	there's nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working,
21:11:00	earning more money, paying more taxes. That's by far the most effective and efficient way
21:16:00	to get this budget balanced.
21:18:00	OBAMA: Jim, I -- you may want to move onto another topic, but I -- I would just say this
21:21:00	to the American people. If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2
21:29:00	trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion -- just to
21:35:00	give you a sense, over 10 years, that's more than our entire defense budget -- and you
21:42:00	think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end
21:47:00	up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney's plan may work for you.
21:53:00	But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth.
22:00:00	Look, we've tried this. We've tried both approaches. The approach that Governor Romney's talking
22:07:00	about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the
22:15:00	slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all
22:22:00	culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
22:25:00	OBAMA: Bill Clinton tried the approach that I'm talking about. We created 23 million new
22:30:00	jobs. We went from deficit to surplus. And businesses did very well. So, in some ways,
22:39:00	we've got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for
22:44:00	Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting
22:49:00	tax breaks so that they've got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have
22:54:00	done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that
22:59:00	we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we're not blowing up the deficit.
23:02:00	ROMNEY: Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word.
23:06:00	(CROSSTALK)
23:06:00	LEHRER: Well, you're going to get the first word in the next segment.
23:08:00	ROMNEY: All right. Well, but he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last word
23:11:00	(inaudible) I hope. Let me just make this comment.
23:13:00	(CROSSTALK)
23:13:00	ROMNEY: I think first of all, let me -- let me repeat -- let me repeat what I said. I'm
23:17:00	not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. That's not my plan. My plan is not to put in place
23:23:00	any tax cut that will add to the deficit. That's point one.
23:26:00	So you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that's not my plan.
23:30:00	Number two, let's look at history. My plan is not like anything that's been tried before.
23:36:00	My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits
23:40:00	at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people
23:46:00	working.
23:46:00	My priority is putting people back to work in America. They're suffering in this country.
23:51:00	And we talk about evidence. Look at the evidence of the last four years. It's absolutely extraordinary.
23:58:00	We've got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country.
24:03:00	It's just -- it's -- we've got -- when the president took office, 32 million people on
24:07:00	food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last
24:13:00	year, and last year slower than the year before.
24:16:00	Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are
24:20:00	struggling today.
24:21:00	LEHRER: All right. Let's talk -- we're still on the economy. This is, theoretically now,
24:26:00	a second segment still on the economy, and specifically on what to do about the federal
24:33:00	deficit, the federal debt.
24:35:00	And the question, you each have two minutes on this, and Governor Romney, you -- you go
24:40:00	first because the president went first on segment one. And the question is this, what
24:44:00	are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the
24:50:00	deficit problem in this country?
24:51:00	ROMNEY: Good. I'm glad you raised that, and it's a -- it's a critical issue. I think it's
24:56:00	not just an economic issue, I think it's a moral issue. I think it's, frankly, not moral
25:01:00	for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens
25:06:00	are going to be passed on to the next generation and they're going to be paying the interest
25:10:00	and the principal all their lives.
25:12:00	And the amount of debt we're adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.
25:17:00	So how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit.
25:22:00	One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number is to grow
25:27:00	the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they're paying taxes, and
25:32:00	you can get the job done that way.
25:34:00	The presidents would -- president would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with
25:38:00	raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth. And you could never quite get the
25:42:00	job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.
25:47:00	What things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs
25:51:00	by this test, if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money
25:56:00	from China to pay for it? And if not, I'll get rid of it. Obamacare's on my list.
26:00:00	I apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all respect, by the way.
26:03:00	OBAMA: I like it.
26:04:00	ROMNEY: Good. OK, good. So I'll get rid of that.
26:06:00	I'm sorry, Jim, I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I'm going to stop other things. I
26:11:00	like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually like you, too. But I'm not going to -- I'm not going
26:15:00	to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for. That's number
26:19:00	one.
26:19:00	Number two, I'll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more
26:23:00	efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.
26:27:00	ROMNEY: Number three, I'll make government more efficient and to cut back the number
26:30:00	of employees, combine some agencies and departments. My cutbacks will be done through attrition,
26:35:00	by the way.
26:36:00	This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.
26:39:00	The president said he'd cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it. Trillion-dollar
26:45:00	deficits for the last four years. The president's put it in place as much public debt -- almost
26:51:00	as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined.
26:55:00	LEHRER: Mr. President, two minutes.
26:57:00	OBAMA: When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit
27:01:00	greeting me. And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card;
27:08:00	two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid
27:14:00	for; and then a massive economic crisis.
27:20:00	And despite that, what we've said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures
27:25:00	to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression, but what we've also said is, let's make sure
27:31:00	that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.
27:34:00	So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but
27:41:00	weren't working very well, 18 government -- 18 government programs for education that were
27:46:00	well-intentioned, not weren't helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare
27:53:00	and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions
27:58:00	of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system.
28:01:00	And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary
28:07:00	domestic budget. That's the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight
28:12:00	Eisenhower.
28:13:00	Now, we all know that we've got to do more. And so I've put forward a specific $4 trillion
28:20:00	deficit reduction plan. It's on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts
28:24:00	we make and what revenue we raise.
28:28:00	And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid
28:36:00	for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country
28:41:00	to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned
28:45:00	the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission
28:51:00	that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced
28:54:00	way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor
29:00:00	Romney and I have.
29:01:00	Let -- let me just finish their point, because you're looking for contrast. You know, when
29:06:00	Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and
29:12:00	he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no.
29:23:00	Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting
29:29:00	our investments in schools and education. It means that Governor Romney...
29:34:00	(CROSSTALK)
29:34:00	OBAMA: ... talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively
29:38:00	this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing
29:43:00	homes, for kids who are with disabilities.
29:45:00	LEHRER: Mr. President, I'm sorry.
29:46:00	OBAMA: And -- and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.
29:49:00	LEHRER: Way over the two minutes.
29:50:00	OBAMA: Sorry.
29:51:00	LEHRER: Governor, what about Simpson-Bowles? Do you support Simpson-Bowles?
29:54:00	ROMNEY: Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.
29:57:00	LEHRER: No, I mean, do you support Simpson-Bowles?
29:58:00	ROMNEY: I have my own plan. It's not the same as Simpson- Bowles. But in my view, the president
30:03:00	should have grabbed it. If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress,
30:07:00	fight for it.
30:08:00	OBAMA: That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it, and we're putting it forward before
30:11:00	Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan...
30:12:00	ROMNEY: But you've been -- but you've been president four years...
30:14:00	(CROSSTALK)
30:14:00	ROMNEY: You've been president four years. You said you'd cut the deficit in half. It's
30:17:00	now four years later. We still have trillion-dollar deficits. The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar
30:21:00	deficit each of the next four years. If you're re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar
30:26:00	debt.
30:26:00	ROMNEY: I mean, you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half. And this -- I love
30:30:00	this idea of $4 trillion in cuts. You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer
30:35:00	to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. That
30:39:00	doesn't get the job done.
30:41:00	Let me come back and say, why is it that I don't want to raise taxes? Why don't I want
30:46:00	to raise taxes on people? And actually, you said it back in 2010. You said, "Look, I'm
30:51:00	going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I'm not going to raise taxes on anyone,
30:56:00	because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we're in recession, you shouldn't
30:59:00	raise taxes on anyone."
31:01:00	Well, the economy is still growing slow. As a matter of fact, it's growing much more slowly
31:05:00	now than when you made that statement. And so if you believe the same thing, you just
31:10:00	don't want to raise taxes on people. And the reality is it's not just wealthy people -- you
31:14:00	mentioned Donald Trump. It's not just Donald Trump you're taxing. It's all those businesses
31:18:00	that employ one-quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed
31:22:00	as individuals.
31:24:00	You raise taxes and you kill jobs. That's why the National Federation of Independent
31:28:00	Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs. I don't want to kill jobs in this environment.
31:34:00	I'll make one more point.
31:35:00	(CROSSTALK)
31:36:00	LEHRER: (inaudible) answer the taxes thing for a moment.
31:38:00	ROMNEY: OK.
31:39:00	LEHRER: Mr. President?
31:40:00	OBAMA: Well, we've had this discussion before.
31:43:00	LEHRER: About the idea that in order to reduce the deficit, there has to be revenue in addition
31:49:00	to cuts.
31:49:00	OBAMA: There has to be revenue in addition to cuts. Now, Governor Romney has ruled out
31:53:00	revenue. He's ruled out revenue.
31:56:00	(CROSSTALK)
31:56:00	ROMNEY: Absolutely. (CROSSTALK)
31:57:00	ROMNEY: Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying
32:03:00	more taxes. That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget. But the idea of taxing
32:07:00	people more, putting more people out of work, you'll never get there. You'll never balance
32:12:00	the budget by raising taxes.
32:14:00	Spain -- Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government. We're now spending
32:20:00	42 percent of our economy on government. I don't want to go down the path to Spain. I
32:24:00	want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in
32:29:00	because they're working.
32:30:00	LEHRER: But -- but Mr. President, you're saying in order to -- to get the job done, it's got
32:35:00	to be balanced. You've got to have...
32:36:00	(CROSSTALK)
32:36:00	OBAMA: If -- if we're serious, we've got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And
32:40:00	by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. Let's talk about corporate
32:44:00	taxes.
32:46:00	Now, I've identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually
32:53:00	help the economy.
32:54:00	The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions
33:02:00	that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get.
33:06:00	Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they're making money
33:14:00	every time you go to the pump? Why wouldn't we want to eliminate that? Why wouldn't we
33:20:00	eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you
33:26:00	can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it.
33:30:00	When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue
33:34:00	neutral way, close loopholes, deductions -- he hasn't identified which ones they are -- but
33:41:00	that thereby bring down the corporate rate.
33:44:00	Well, I want to do the same thing, but I've actually identified how we can do that. And
33:49:00	part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs
33:53:00	overseas.
33:54:00	Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most
34:01:00	Americans would say that doesn't make sense. And all that raises revenue.
34:05:00	And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help
34:12:00	young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can
34:16:00	afford to go to college.
34:17:00	OBAMA: It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who
34:23:00	describes to me -- she's got 42 kids in her class. The first two weeks she's got them,
34:29:00	some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. They're using text books
34:33:00	that are 10 years old.
34:36:00	That is not a recipe for growth. That's not how America was built. And so budgets reflect
34:42:00	choices.
34:43:00	Ultimately, we're going to have to make some decisions. And if we're asking for no revenue,
34:48:00	then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff.
34:51:00	And the magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor, would end up resulting
34:56:00	in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow.
35:02:00	As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking
35:07:00	about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time.
35:12:00	Now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on
35:20:00	a sheet of paper, but if we're talking about a family who's got an autistic kid and is
35:24:00	depending on that Medicaid, that's a big problem.
35:28:00	And governors are creative. There's no doubt about it. But they're not creative enough
35:31:00	to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some
35:36:00	people end up not getting help.
35:38:00	ROMNEY: Jim, let's -- we've gone on a lot of topics there, and so it's going to take
35:43:00	a minute to go from Medicaid to schools...
35:45:00	LEHRER: Come back to...
35:46:00	(CROSSTALK)
35:46:00	ROMNEY: ... to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas. So let's go through them one
35:49:00	by one.
35:50:00	First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8
35:54:00	billion a year. And it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place
35:58:00	for a hundred years. Now...
36:00:00	OBAMA: It's time to end it.
36:02:00	ROMNEY: And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.
36:09:00	Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas
36:14:00	receives. And you say Exxon and Mobil. Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies,
36:20:00	to drilling operators and so forth.
36:21:00	ROMNEY: But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why
36:26:00	that $2.8 billion is on the table. Of course it's on the table. That's probably not going
36:29:00	to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent.
36:32:00	But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar
36:39:00	and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1. I mean, I had a friend who said
36:46:00	you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right? So this -- this
36:49:00	is not -- this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy
36:54:00	secure.
36:55:00	The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas. Look,
36:59:00	I've been in business for 25 years. I have no idea what you're talking about. I maybe
37:04:00	need to get a new accountant.
37:05:00	LEHRER: Let's...
37:06:00	ROMNEY: But -- but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply
37:09:00	not the case.
37:10:00	(CROSSTALK)
37:10:00	ROMNEY: What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas
37:14:00	back to this country.
37:15:00	And, finally, Medicaid to states? I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this,
37:19:00	which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state,
37:24:00	you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're
37:30:00	going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.
37:33:00	And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors
37:38:00	Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that. We can care for our own poor
37:44:00	in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us
37:48:00	how to care for our poor.
37:51:00	So -- so let's state -- one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea
37:55:00	that states are the laboratories of democracy. Don't have the federal government tell everybody
37:59:00	what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to
38:04:00	have. Let states do this.
38:05:00	And, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find
38:08:00	a way to help them.
38:09:00	LEHRER: Let's go.
38:10:00	ROMNEY: But -- but the right -- the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance
38:14:00	of our people and states, not the federal government.
38:16:00	LEHRER: (inaudible) and we're going on -- still on the economy, on another -- but another
38:19:00	part of it...
38:19:00	OBAMA: OK.
38:20:00	LEHRER: All right? All right. This is segment three, the economy. Entitlements. First -- first
38:25:00	answer goes to you, two minutes, Mr. President. Do you see a major difference between the
38:32:00	two of you on Social Security?
38:34:00	OBAMA: You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position.
38:40:00	Social Security is structurally sound. It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was
38:45:00	by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill. But it is -- the basic
38:51:00	structure is sound.
38:53:00	But -- but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then
38:57:00	talk about Medicare, because that's the big driver of our deficits right now.
39:02:00	You know, my grandmother -- some of you know -- helped to raise me. My grandparents did.
39:09:00	My grandfather died a while back. My grandmother died three days before I was elected president.
39:15:00	And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up, only had a high school education,
39:19:00	started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. And she ended
39:25:00	up living alone by choice.
39:28:00	And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare. She
39:33:00	had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee,
39:38:00	a floor under which she could not go.
39:40:00	And that's the perspective I bring when I think about what's called entitlements. You
39:45:00	know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These
39:50:00	are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there
39:54:00	who are counting on this.
39:55:00	OBAMA: So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term?
40:01:00	And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs
40:07:00	if we're going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let's look where
40:12:00	some of the money's going.
40:14:00	$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance
40:21:00	companies by making sure that we weren't overpaying providers. And using that money, we were actually
40:28:00	able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were
40:33:00	also able to make a -- make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive
40:37:00	care that will ultimately save money through the -- throughout the system.
40:41:00	So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs.
40:47:00	When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don't need a major structural change in
40:52:00	order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.
40:55:00	LEHRER: We'll follow up on this.
40:56:00	First, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements.
41:01:00	ROMNEY: Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about
41:07:00	entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going to
41:10:00	change their life for the worse.
41:12:00	And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current
41:17:00	retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if you're 60 or around
41:23:00	60 or older, you don't need to listen any further.
41:26:00	But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring. Oh,
41:30:00	I just thought about one. And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president
41:34:00	isn't proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact he is on Medicare. On Social Security
41:38:00	he's not.
41:39:00	But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program. Now,
41:46:00	he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers. Actually just going to them and saying, "We're
41:51:00	going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody's going to get a lower
41:55:00	rate." That's not just going after places where there's abuse. That's saying we're cutting
41:58:00	the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take anymore
42:03:00	Medicare patients under that scenario.
42:06:00	We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients.
42:12:00	This -- we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage
42:16:00	because of those $716 billion in cuts. I can't understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion
42:25:00	for current recipients of Medicare.
42:27:00	Now, you point out, well, we're putting some back. We're going to give a better prescription
42:30:00	program. That's $1 -- that's $1 for every $15 you've cut. They're smart enough to know
42:36:00	that's not a good trade.
42:37:00	I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way,
42:43:00	we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.
42:46:00	But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional
42:51:00	cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.
42:54:00	And with regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and
42:59:00	Social Security are there for them without any question.
43:02:00	LEHRER: Mr. President?
43:04:00	OBAMA: First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that
43:08:00	he says will only affect folks in the future.
43:12:00	And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program. It's
43:18:00	called premium support, but it's understood to be a voucher program. His running mate...
43:23:00	LEHRER: And you don't support that?
43:24:00	OBAMA: I don't. And let me explain why.
43:27:00	ROMNEY: Again, that's for future...
43:29:00	OBAMA: I understand.
43:29:00	ROMNEY: ... people, right, not for current retirees.
43:30:00	OBAMA: For -- so if you're -- if you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen 'cause this
43:36:00	 this will affect you.
43:39:00	The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that
43:46:00	we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and
43:52:00	buy their own health insurance.
43:54:00	The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation,
44:00:00	it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.
44:04:00	Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare
44:10:00	alongside it. But there's still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies
44:16:00	are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors. They recruit
44:22:00	them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare. And every health care economist
44:27:00	that looks at it says, over time, what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system
44:31:00	will collapse.
44:32:00	OBAMA: And then what you've got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private
44:37:00	insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care.
44:43:00	So, I don't think vouchers are the right way to go. And this is not my own -- only my opinion.
44:50:00	AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system,
44:57:00	lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years. Benefits were not affected at all.
45:03:00	And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, "Obamacare,"
45:09:00	if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more
45:15:00	in prescription care. They're now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups
45:19:00	that can keep them healthier.
45:22:00	And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated
45:31:00	to gain billions of dollars back when they aren't making seniors any healthier. And I
45:36:00	don't think that's the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger
45:41:00	over the long term.
45:41:00	LEHRER: We'll talk about -- specifically about health care in a moment. But what -- do you
45:46:00	support the voucher system, Governor?
45:47:00	ROMNEY: What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare. And
45:54:00	the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.
45:58:00	LEHRER: And what about the vouchers?
45:59:00	(CROSSTALK)
45:59:00	ROMNEY: So that's -- that's number one.
46:01:00	Number two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we
46:05:00	can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare
46:11:00	program or a private plan. Their choice.
46:15:00	They get to choose -- and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no
46:18:00	cost to them. So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000. That's not going
46:22:00	to happen. They'll have at least two plans.
46:23:00	ROMNEY: And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector
46:27:00	and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get
46:31:00	traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan.
46:34:00	I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan. I'd just assume not have the government
46:39:00	telling me what kind of health care I get. I'd rather be able to have an insurance company.
46:42:00	If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. But
46:45:00	people make their own choice.
46:47:00	The other thing we have to do to save Medicare? We have to have the benefits high for those
46:51:00	that are low income, but for higher income people, we're going to have to lower some
46:56:00	of the benefits. We have to make sure this program is there for the long term. That's
47:00:00	the plan that I've put forward.
47:01:00	And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or -- or Senator Wyden, who's the
47:05:00	co-author of the bill with -- with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill
47:09:00	-- Bill Clinton's chief of staff. This is an idea that's been around a long time, which
47:13:00	is saying, hey, let's see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that
47:18:00	people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe in
47:23:00	competition.
47:24:00	OBAMA: Jim, if I -- if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has
47:29:00	shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is
47:34:00	why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.
47:37:00	And private insurers have to make a profit. Nothing wrong with that. That's what they
47:41:00	do. And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that. And if
47:50:00	you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen
47:56:00	is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.
47:59:00	And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those
48:04:00	insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then
48:12:00	they're stuck.
48:13:00	And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially.
48:22:00	And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.
48:25:00	One last point I want to make. We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just
48:30:00	in Medicare and Medicaid... LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute.
48:32:00	OBAMA: ... but -- but -- but overall.
48:33:00	LEHRER: OK.
48:34:00	OBAMA: And so...
48:35:00	ROMNEY: That's -- that's a big topic. Can we -- can we stay on Medicare?
48:37:00	OBAMA: Is that a -- is that a separate topic?
48:38:00	(CROSSTALK)
48:38:00	LEHRER: Yeah, we're going to -- yeah, I want to get to it.
48:39:00	OBAMA: I'm sorry.
48:39:00	LEHRER: But all I want to do is go very quickly...
48:41:00	ROMNEY: Let's get back to Medicare.
48:42:00	LEHRER: ... before we leave the economy...
48:42:00	ROMNEY: Let's get back to Medicare.
48:43:00	(CROSSTALK)
48:43:00	ROMNEY: The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and
48:47:00	without a profit.
48:48:00	LEHRER: All right.
48:48:00	ROMNEY: If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.
48:52:00	LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor.
48:53:00	ROMNEY: But my experience -- my experience the private sector typically is able to provide
48:57:00	a better product at a lower cost.
48:58:00	LEHRER: All right. Can we -- can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice -- a
49:02:00	clear choice between the two...
49:04:00	ROMNEY: Absolutely.
49:04:00	LEHRER: ... of you on Medicare?
49:05:00	ROMNEY: Absolutely.
49:06:00	OBAMA: Absolutely.
49:06:00	LEHRER: All right. So to finish quickly, briefly, on the economy, what is your view about the
49:12:00	level of federal regulation of the economy right now? Is there too much? And in your
49:16:00	case, Mr. President, is there -- should there be more?
49:19:00	Beginning with you. This is not a new two-minute segment to start. And we'll go for a few minutes,
49:26:00	and then we're going to go to health care, OK?
49:28:00	ROMNEY: Regulation is essential. You can't have a free market work if you don't have
49:33:00	regulation. As a businessperson, I had to have -- I need to know the regulations. I
49:37:00	needed them there. You couldn't have people opening up banks in their -- in their garage
49:41:00	and making loans. I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy
49:46:00	work. Every free economy has good regulation. At the same time, regulation can become excessive.
49:51:00	LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do you think?
49:53:00	ROMNEY: In some places, yes. Other places, no.
49:54:00	LEHRER: Like where?
49:54:00	(CROSSTALK)
49:55:00	ROMNEY: No, it can become out of date. And what's happened with some of the legislation
49:59:00	that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive,
50:04:00	and it's hurt -- it's hurt the economy. Let me give you an example.
50:08:00	Dodd-Frank was passed. And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has
50:13:00	some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy. One is it designates a number
50:18:00	of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government. This
50:23:00	is the biggest kiss that's been given to -- to New York banks I've ever seen. This is an
50:27:00	enormous boon for them. There've been 122 community and small banks have closed since
50:33:00	Dodd- Frank.
50:33:00	So there's one example. Here's another. In Dodd-Frank...
50:36:00	LEHRER: Do you want to repeal Dodd-Frank?
50:37:00	ROMNEY: Well, I would repeal and replace it. We're not going to get rid of all regulation.
50:41:00	You have to have regulation. And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the
50:45:00	sense in the world. You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for...
50:50:00	LEHRER: Well, here's a specific...
50:51:00	(CROSSTALK)
50:51:00	ROMNEY: But let's -- let's mention -- let me mention the other one. Let's talk...
50:54:00	(CROSSTALK)
50:54:00	LEHRER: No, let's not. Let's let him respond -- let's let him respond to this specific
50:59:00	on Dodd-Frank and what the governor just said.
51:02:00	OBAMA: I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a enormous economic
51:10:00	crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.
51:17:00	Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street. You had loan officers were -- that were giving loans
51:23:00	and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify. You
51:28:00	had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford. You had
51:32:00	credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren't.
51:38:00	But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers
51:44:00	themselves didn't even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made
51:50:00	the entire system vulnerable.
51:53:00	So what did we do? We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the
52:00:00	1930s. We said you've got -- banks, you've got to raise your capital requirements. You
52:04:00	can't engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk. We've
52:08:00	going to make sure that you've got to have a living will so -- so we can know how you're
52:12:00	going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts.
52:17:00	OBAMA: In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided
52:21:00	those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest.
52:25:00	Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.
52:29:00	And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace
52:35:00	to work has to have some regulation. But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just
52:39:00	want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.
52:42:00	And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that
52:50:00	there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor
52:57:00	Romney is your candidate. But that's not what I believe.
53:02:00	ROMNEY: Sorry, but that's just not -- that's just not the facts. Look, we have to have
53:06:00	regulation on Wall Street. That's why I'd have regulation. But I wouldn't designate
53:10:00	five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check. That's one of the unintended
53:16:00	consequences of Dodd-Frank. It wasn't thought through properly. We need to get rid of that
53:19:00	provision because it's killing regional and small banks. They're getting hurt.
53:23:00	Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank. You say we were giving mortgages to people
53:27:00	who weren't qualified. That's exactly right. It's one of the reasons for the great financial
53:31:00	calamity we had. And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages,
53:37:00	and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn't
53:41:00	ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was.
53:45:00	It's been two years. We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet. So banks are reluctant
53:50:00	to make loans, mortgages. Try and get a mortgage these days. It's hurt the housing market because
53:56:00	Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have.
54:02:00	It's not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation. Sometimes they didn't
54:06:00	come out with a clear regulation.
54:08:00	I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our -- of our marketplace and our business,
54:13:00	because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.
54:15:00	LEHRER: All right. I think we have another clear difference between the two of you. Now,
54:21:00	let's move to health care where I know there is a clear difference, and that has to do
54:26:00	with the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. And it's a two-minute new -- new segment, and
54:33:00	that means two minutes each. And you go first, Governor Romney.
54:36:00	LEHRER: You want it repealed. You want the Affordable Care Act repealed. Why?
54:40:00	ROMNEY: I sure do. Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. You know, I was
54:46:00	in New Hampshire. A woman came to me and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself
54:50:00	or my son. I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we're thinking of dropping
54:55:00	our insurance, we can't afford it.
54:57:00	And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance
55:01:00	because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. And -- and
55:06:00	we've got to deal with cost.
55:07:00	And, unfortunately, when -- when -- when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget
55:12:00	Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. So it's adding
55:18:00	to cost. And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by
55:23:00	this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500
55:28:00	a family. Instead, it's gone up by that amount. So it's expensive. Expensive things hurt families.
55:34:00	So that's one reason I don't want it.
55:35:00	Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back
55:41:00	in Medicare for our seniors.
55:43:00	Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately
55:48:00	what kind of treatments they can have. I don't like that idea.
55:51:00	Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what's been the
55:57:00	effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans? And three-quarters of them said it makes us
56:01:00	less likely to hire people. I just don't know how the president could have come into office,
56:08:00	facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the -- at
56:13:00	the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare
56:18:00	instead of fighting for jobs for the American people. It has killed jobs.
56:22:00	And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at
56:27:00	the state level that fits the needs of the state. And then let's focus on getting the
56:32:00	costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.
56:37:00	LEHRER: Mr. President, the argument against repeal? OBAMA: Well, four years ago, when
56:43:00	I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations
56:46:00	that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasn't just that small businesses were seeing costs
56:53:00	skyrocket and they couldn't get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it
56:57:00	to their employees. It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit,
57:01:00	our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt
57:07:00	if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.
57:11:00	If they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all.
57:16:00	If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. And so as
57:23:00	a consequence, they're paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold,
57:28:00	they don't have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they've
57:33:00	hit the limit.
57:35:00	So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure
57:40:00	that middle-class families are secure in this country.
57:43:00	And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did. Number one, if you've got health insurance,
57:48:00	it doesn't mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own
57:55:00	doctor. But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around. They can't impose arbitrary
58:00:00	lifetime limits. They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance
58:06:00	plan until you're 26 years old. And it also says that you're going to have to get rebates
58:13:00	if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they
58:19:00	are on actual care.
58:22:00	Number two, if you don't have health insurance, we're essentially setting up a group plan
58:27:00	that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if
58:32:00	you're out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.
58:36:00	Now, the last point I'd make before...
58:38:00	LEHRER: Two minutes -- two minutes is up, sir.
58:41:00	OBAMA: No, I think -- I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was ...
58:43:00	(LAUGHTER)
58:47:00	... the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because
58:57:00	Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what
59:04:00	is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there. It
59:10:00	hasn't destroyed jobs. And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the
59:16:00	opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people
59:21:00	out in the cold.
59:22:00	LEHRER: Your five seconds went away a long time ago.
59:25:00	All right, Governor. Governor, tell -- tell the president directly why you think what
59:30:00	he just said is wrong about Obamacare?
59:31:00	ROMNEY: Well, I did with my first statement.
59:35:00	(CROSSTALK)
59:36:00	ROMNEY: First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that
59:42:00	in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together. What you
59:47:00	did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote. As a matter of fact,
59:52:00	when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary -- elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare,
59:57:00	you pushed it through anyway.
59:58:00	So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion
60:03:00	on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry
60:07:00	Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through.
60:09:00	What we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my
60:16:00	legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished. What were some
60:20:00	differences? We didn't raise taxes. You've raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare.
60:25:00	We didn't cut Medicare. Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare
60:29:00	by $716 billion.
60:30:00	ROMNEY: We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments
60:34:00	they're going to receive. We didn't also do something that I think a number of people
60:41:00	across this country recognize, which is put -- put people in a position where they're
60:43:00	going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted.
60:47:00	Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes
60:52:00	into effect next year. And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses
60:57:00	said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.
61:01:00	So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their
61:07:00	insurance, this is why the American people don't want Medicare -- don't want Obamacare.
61:12:00	It's why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had -- had the plan. They
61:16:00	put a plan out. They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside.
61:20:00	I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis. And
61:25:00	we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation
61:30:00	with the input from both parties.
61:32:00	OBAMA: Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This was a bipartisan
61:37:00	idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate
61:42:00	wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.
61:46:00	And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice
61:52:00	to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the
61:58:00	same advisers, and they say it's the same plan.
62:02:00	It -- when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we've
62:08:00	created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure
62:14:00	out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?
62:21:00	Because there -- there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply
62:27:00	leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses
62:32:00	figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up,
62:37:00	and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that's been the trend line.
62:41:00	Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective?
62:45:00	And there are ways of doing it.
62:47:00	So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide
62:54:00	great care cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things.
63:01:00	They -- they say, if a patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors together at once,
63:06:00	do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Let's make sure
63:12:00	that we're providing preventive care so we're catching the onset of something like diabetes.
63:17:00	Let's -- let's pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis
63:24:00	of how many procedures they've -- they've engaged in.
63:29:00	Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let's
63:34:00	use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good
63:41:00	things that we do.
63:42:00	And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in
63:49:00	a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums
63:56:00	have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years.
64:01:00	So we're already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance,
64:06:00	you're already getting a rebate.
64:08:00	Let me make one last point. Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I'm just going
64:14:00	to repeal it, but -- but we can replace it with something. But the problem is, he hasn't
64:18:00	described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it
64:22:00	to the states.
64:23:00	OBAMA: But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered,
64:28:00	like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow
64:33:00	is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance.
64:37:00	In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people
64:43:00	losing health insurance...
64:44:00	LEHRER: Let's...
64:44:00	OBAMA: ... at a time when it's vitally important.
64:46:00	LEHRER: Let's let the governor explain what you would do...
64:48:00	ROMNEY: Well...
64:49:00	LEHRER: ... if Obamacare is repealed. How would you replace it?
64:52:00	(CROSSTALK)
64:52:00	ROMNEY: Well, actually it's -- it's -- it's a lengthy description. But, number one, preexisting
64:57:00	conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their
65:01:00	family plan. That's already offered in the private marketplace. You don't have to have
65:05:00	the government mandate that for that to occur.
65:08:00	But let's come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have
65:14:00	in health care is to get the cost down so it's more affordable for families. And then
65:19:00	he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board,
65:25:00	appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have.
65:28:00	(CROSSTALK)
65:29:00	ROMNEY: In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost
65:35:00	of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find
65:40:00	ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the
65:44:00	government will ever be.
65:46:00	Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I
65:51:00	could describe.
65:52:00	This is the private market. These are small -- these are enterprises competing with each
65:57:00	other, learning how to do better and better jobs. I used to consult to businesses -- excuse
66:01:00	me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation
66:06:00	that exists in the American people.
66:09:00	In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15
66:14:00	people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance
66:20:00	plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say,
66:26:00	performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that's happening.
66:30:00	Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well,
66:35:00	Cleveland Clinic, others.
66:36:00	ROMNEY: But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care
66:41:00	and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what
66:48:00	kind of treatment they can have.
66:49:00	That's the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work
66:54:00	best.
66:55:00	OBAMA: Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't
67:00:00	make decisions about what treatments are given. That's explicitly prohibited in the law. But
67:06:00	let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover
67:13:00	people with preexisting conditions.
67:15:00	Well, actually Governor, that isn't what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate
67:22:00	what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months,
67:29:00	then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if
67:37:00	you've -- if it's been under 90 days.
67:40:00	But that's already the law and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with
67:45:00	preexisting conditions. There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did
67:50:00	in Massachusetts. It wasn't a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion
67:55:00	of private insurance. But what it does say is that "insurers, you've got to take everybody."
68:02:00	Now, that also means that you've got more customers. But when -- when Governor Romney
68:07:00	says that he'll replace it with something, but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced
68:14:00	and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn't a
68:19:00	better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem.
68:23:00	OBAMA: It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and
68:27:00	loopholes for his tax plan. That's how it's going to be paid for, but we don't know the
68:31:00	details. He says that he's going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don't
68:39:00	know exactly which ones. He won't tell us. He now says he's going to replace Obamacare
68:44:00	and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't
68:48:00	have to worry.
68:50:00	And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that
68:54:00	Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?
69:02:00	Is it -- is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from
69:06:00	them?
69:07:00	No. The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of
69:14:00	pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices.
69:20:00	And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class
69:24:00	families all across the country.
69:25:00	LEHRER: We're going to move to...
69:26:00	ROMNEY: No. I -- I have to respond to that.
69:27:00	LEHRER: No, but...
69:28:00	ROMNEY: Which is -- which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and -- and lay
69:33:00	down a piece of legislation and say, "It's my way or the highway," I don't get a lot
69:37:00	done. What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years
69:41:00	ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going
69:47:00	to foster. He said he was going to lower tax rates. He said he was going to broaden the
69:51:00	base. You've said the same thing, you're going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.
69:55:00	Those are my principles. I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families.
69:59:00	And I'm going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what -- what are the various ways
70:03:00	we could bring down deductions, for instance? One way, for instance, would be to have a
70:06:00	single number. Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to
70:12:00	that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people. That's one way one
70:16:00	could do it. One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction
70:21:00	and make differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which
70:26:00	is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for
70:32:00	growth. And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my
70:36:00	pre-existing condition plan. You obviously studied up on -- on my plan. In fact, I do
70:41:00	have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. That's part of my health care
70:45:00	plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state. And
70:51:00	I said that at that time.
70:52:00	The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside
70:57:00	the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the
71:01:00	course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.
71:04:00	LEHRER: That is a terrific segue to our next segment, and is the role of government. And
71:13:00	-- and let's see. Role of government. And it is -- you are first on this, Mr. President.
71:19:00	And the question is this. Do you believe, both of you -- but you had the first two minutes
71:25:00	on this, Mr. President -- do you believe there's a fundamental difference between the two of
71:29:00	you as to how you view the mission of the federal government?
71:34:00	OBAMA: Well, I definitely think there are differences.
71:38:00	LEHRER: And do you -- yeah.
71:39:00	OBAMA: The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe. That's
71:43:00	its most basic function. And as commander-in-chief, that is something that I've worked on and
71:52:00	thought about every single day that I've been in the Oval Office.
71:56:00	But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity
72:03:00	to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where
72:08:00	the American people can succeed.
72:10:00	Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people
72:16:00	can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.
72:22:00	OBAMA: But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together.
72:28:00	So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let's help to finance the Transcontinental
72:34:00	Railroad, let's start the National Academy of Sciences, let's start land grant colleges,
72:43:00	because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if
72:49:00	all Americans are getting opportunity, we're all going to be better off. That doesn't restrict
72:53:00	people's freedom. That enhances it.
72:56:00	And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.
73:01:00	And when it comes to education what I've said is we've got to reform schools that are not
73:07:00	working. We use something called Race to the Top. Wasn't a top-down approach, Governor.
73:11:00	What we've said is to states, we'll give you more money if you initiate reforms. And as
73:17:00	a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.
73:22:00	But what I've also said is let's hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make
73:27:00	sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed.
73:33:00	And hard-pressed states right now can't all do that. In fact we've seen layoffs of hundreds
73:39:00	of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn't think we
73:44:00	need more teachers. I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where
73:49:00	the federal government can help.
73:50:00	It can't do it all, but it can make a difference. And as a consequence we'll have a better trained
73:56:00	workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we've
74:00:00	got a skilled workforce.
74:01:00	LEHRER: Two minutes, Governor, on the role of government. Your view?
74:04:00	ROMNEY: Well, first, I love great schools. Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number
74:08:00	one of all 50 states. And the key to great schools, great teachers.
74:12:00	So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every
74:16:00	school district, every state should make that decision on their own.
74:19:00	The role of government: Look behind us. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.
74:25:00	The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.
74:31:00	ROMNEY: First, life and liberty. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties
74:37:00	of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military.
74:42:00	I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military.
74:45:00	Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe
74:51:00	we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That
74:57:00	statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness
75:02:00	as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate
75:06:00	and can't care for themselves are cared by -- by one another.
75:09:00	We're a nation that believes that we're all children of the same god and we care for those
75:14:00	that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that
75:18:00	are disabled. We care for them. And we -- we look for discovery and innovation, all these
75:22:00	things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.
75:29:00	But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to
75:34:00	have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what we're
75:39:00	seeing right now is, in my view, a -- a trickle-down government approach, which has government
75:45:00	thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And it's not
75:48:00	working.
75:50:00	And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is 1 out of
75:53:00	6 people in poverty. The proof of that is we've gone from 32 million on food stamps
75:58:00	to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates
76:04:00	this year can't find work.
76:05:00	LEHRER: All right.
76:06:00	ROMNEY: We know that the path we're taking is not working. It's time for a new path.
76:10:00	LEHRER: All right. Let's go through some specifics in terms of what -- how each of you views
76:14:00	the role of government. How do -- education. Does the federal government have a responsibility
76:20:00	to improve the quality of public education in America?
76:23:00	ROMNEY: Well, the primary responsibility for education is -- is, of course, at the state
76:26:00	and local level. But the federal government also can play a very important role. And I
76:30:00	-- and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he's -- some ideas he's put forward on Race
76:35:00	to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and -- and congratulate him for
76:38:00	pursuing that. The federal government can get local and -- and state schools to do a
76:42:00	better job.
76:43:00	My own view, by the way, is I've added to that. I happen to believe, I want the kids
76:48:00	that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I -- these are disabled kids or -- or
76:53:00	or poor kids or -- or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the
76:58:00	school of their choice.
76:59:00	So all federal funds, instead of going to the -- to the state or to the school district,
77:04:00	I'd have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where
77:08:00	to send their -- their -- their student.
77:09:00	LEHRER: How do you see the federal government's responsibility to, as I say, to improve the
77:14:00	quality of public education in this country?
77:16:00	OBAMA: Well, as I've indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play. Through
77:21:00	our Race to the Top program, we've worked with Republican and Democratic governors to
77:25:00	initiate major reforms, and they're having an impact right now.
77:28:00	LEHRER: Do you think you have a difference with your views and -- and those of Governor
77:32:00	Romney on -- about education and the federal government?
77:34:00	OBAMA: You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices. So when Governor
77:41:00	Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and
77:49:00	him, and to pay for it we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education,
77:58:00	that makes a difference.
77:59:00	You know, his -- his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many
78:05:00	of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about. And it wasn't very detailed. This seems
78:11:00	to be a trend. But -- but what it did do is to -- if you extrapolated how much money we're
78:16:00	talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.
78:21:00	OBAMA: When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all
78:28:00	over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right
78:32:00	now. And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting
78:36:00	businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training
78:40:00	programs...
78:40:00	LEHRER: Do you -- do you agree, Governor?
78:43:00	OBAMA: Let me just finish the point.
78:46:00	(CROSSTALK)
78:46:00	OBAMA: The -- where they're partnering so that they're designing training programs.
78:54:00	And people who are going through them know that there's a job waiting for them if they
78:57:00	complete it. That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support.
79:01:00	Let me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable, whether
79:08:00	it's two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending
79:12:00	$60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though
79:19:00	the loans were guaranteed. So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they
79:23:00	were taking billions out of the system.
79:25:00	And we said, "Why not cut out the middleman?" And as a consequence, what we've been able
79:29:00	to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates
79:37:00	on student loans. And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.
79:43:00	Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student
79:49:00	that, you know, "you should borrow money from your parents to go to college," you know,
79:55:00	that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the
80:01:00	fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver,
80:07:00	just don't have that option.
80:08:00	And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through
80:13:00	that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids. It's how we're going to grow
80:18:00	this economy over the long term.
80:19:00	LEHRER: We're running out of time, gentlemen.
80:22:00	(CROSSTALK) LEHRER: Governor?
80:23:00	ROMNEY: Mr. President, Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane
80:27:00	and to your own house, but not to your own facts. All right, I'm not going to cut education
80:31:00	funding. I don't have any plan to cut education funding and -- and grants that go to people
80:36:00	going to college. I'm planning on (inaudible) to grow. So I'm not planning on making changes
80:40:00	there.
80:40:00	But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a
80:45:00	pretty clear indication of where your heart is. You put $90 billion into -- into green
80:51:00	jobs. And I -- look, I'm all in favor of green energy. $90 billion, that would have -- that
80:56:00	would have hired 2 million teachers. $90 billion.
81:01:00	And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them,
81:05:00	of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business. A number of them happened
81:08:00	to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.
81:11:00	Look, the right course for America's government, we were talking about the role of government,
81:16:00	is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind
81:21:00	of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed
81:27:00	in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the
81:32:00	world.
81:32:00	The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more
81:36:00	efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive? Let's grade
81:40:00	them. I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing,
81:45:00	so they can take their child to a -- to a school that he's being more successful.
81:48:00	I don't want to cut our commitment to education. I wanted to make it more effective and efficient.
81:54:00	And by the way, I've had that experience. I don't just talk about it. I've been there.
81:59:00	Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation. This is not because I didn't
82:03:00	have commitment to education. It's because I care about education for all of our kids.
82:09:00	LEHRER: All right, gentlemen...
82:10:00	(CROSSTALK)
82:10:00	LEHRER: Excuse me (inaudible). Excuse me, sir. We've got -- we've got -- barely have
82:13:00	three minutes left. I'm not going to grade the two of you and say your answers have been
82:18:00	too long or I've done a poor job.
82:21:00	OBAMA: You've done a great job.
82:22:00	LEHRER: Oh, well, no. But the fact is government -- the role of government and governing, we've
82:27:00	lost a pod in other words. So we only have three -- three minutes left in the -- in the
82:34:00	debate before we go to your closing statements. And so I want to ask finally here, and remember,
82:41:00	we've got three minutes total time here -- and the question is this. Many of the legislative
82:47:00	functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result
82:53:00	of partisan gridlock. If elected, in your case, if re-elected, in your case, what would
82:59:00	you do about that?
83:00:00	Governor?
83:01:00	ROMNEY: Jim, I had the great experience -- it didn't seem like it at the time -- of being
83:05:00	elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. And that meant I figured
83:10:00	out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything
83:14:00	done. We drove our schools to be number one in the nation. We cut taxes 19 times.
83:19:00	LEHRER: But what would you do as president?
83:19:00	ROMNEY: We -- as president, I will sit on day one -- actually, the day after I get elected
83:24:00	-- I'll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and
83:29:00	continue -- as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about
83:32:00	the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state in that case. We have
83:36:00	to work on a collaborative basis, not because we're going to compromise our principle, but
83:41:00	because there's common ground.
83:43:00	And the challenges America faces right now -- look, the reason I'm in this race is there
83:47:00	are people that are really hurting today in this country. And we face -- this deficit
83:51:00	could crush the future generations. What's happening in the Middle East, there are developments
83:56:00	around the world that are of real concern.
83:58:00	LEHRER: All right.
83:59:00	ROMNEY: And Republicans and Democrats both love America. But we need to have leadership
84:04:00	leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done
84:09:00	and could not care less if -- if it's a Republican or a Democrat. I've done it before. I'll do
84:14:00	it again.
84:15:00	LEHRER: Mr. President?
84:16:00	OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day, because
84:18:00	he's also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as
84:22:00	you're sitting down with them.
84:24:00	(LAUGHTER)
84:26:00	But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican,
84:33:00	as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and
84:37:00	giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class. That's how we cut taxes for middle-
84:41:00	class families and small businesses. That's how we cut a trillion dollars of spending
84:45:00	that wasn't advancing that cause. That's how we signed three trade deals into law that
84:50:00	are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world. That's
84:55:00	how we repealed "don't ask/don't tell." That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised,
85:00:00	and that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan. That's how we went after
85:04:00	Al Qaida and bin Laden.
85:06:00	So we've -- we've seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives.
85:12:00	But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to
85:18:00	describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, "I'll sit down," but
85:23:00	you have to have a plan.
85:25:00	Number two, what's important is occasionally you've got to say no, to -- to -- to folks
85:31:00	both in your own party and in the other party. And, you know, yes, have we had some fights
85:36:00	between me and the Republicans when -- when they fought back against us reining in the
85:40:00	excesses of Wall Street? Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had.
85:44:00	When -- when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans
85:49:00	had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that
85:53:00	we needed to have.
85:54:00	LEHRER: All right
85:55:00	OBAMA: And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for,
86:01:00	but also being willing to say no to some things. And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney,
86:05:00	when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed
86:09:00	that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.
86:13:00	LEHRER: That brings us to closing statements. It was a coin toss. Governor Romney, you won
86:19:00	the toss and you elected to go last, so you have a closing two minutes, Mr. President.
86:25:00	OBAMA: Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I
86:28:00	think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it. And I want to thank the University
86:34:00	of Denver.
86:36:00	You know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis. And yet my faith and confidence
86:46:00	in the American future is undiminished. And the reason is because of its people, because
86:53:00	of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted
86:58:00	to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten;
87:02:00	because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives
87:08:00	to make sure that they didn't lay off workers during a recession.
87:11:00	The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best
87:17:00	cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride,
87:23:00	that they're helping to build America. And so the question now is how do we build on
87:27:00	those strengths. And everything that I've tried to do, and everything that I'm now proposing
87:31:00	for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American
87:35:00	energy or making sure that we're closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas
87:40:00	and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United
87:44:00	States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our
87:49:00	future.
87:50:00	All those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their
87:56:00	grit, their determination, is -- is channeled and -- and they have an opportunity to succeed.
88:04:00	And everybody's getting a fair shot. And everybody's getting a fair share -- everybody's doing
88:08:00	a fair share, and everybody's playing by the same rules.
88:11:00	You know, four years ago, I said that I'm not a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect
88:17:00	president. And that's probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I've kept. But I also
88:22:00	promised that I'd fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle
88:27:00	class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class. I've kept that
88:30:00	promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second
88:36:00	term.
88:36:00	LEHRER: Governor Romney, your two-minute closing.
88:38:00	ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President. And thank you for tuning in this evening.
88:43:00	This is a -- this is an important election and I'm concerned about America. I'm concerned
88:47:00	about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.
88:51:00	I -- I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals. It's bigger
88:57:00	than our respective parties. It's an election about the course of America. What kind of
89:01:00	America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.
89:05:00	And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening,
89:08:00	and over the course of this month we're going to have two more presidential debates and
89:11:00	a vice presidential debate. We're talk about those two paths.
89:14:00	But they lead in very different directions. And it's not just looking to our words that
89:18:00	you have to take in evidence of where they go. You can look at the record.
89:21:00	There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you'll continue
89:25:00	to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.
89:30:00	I'll get incomes up again.
89:32:00	You'll see chronic unemployment. We've had 43 straight months with unemployment above
89:36:00	8 percent.
89:37:00	If I'm president I will create -- help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising
89:43:00	incomes.
89:43:00	If the president's reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed. In my view that's going
89:48:00	to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they
89:52:00	had in the past. Many will lose it. You're going to see health premiums go up by some
89:56:00	$2,500 per family.
89:59:00	If I'm elected we won't have Obama. We'll put in place the kind of principles that I
90:03:00	put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people
90:07:00	insured and we'll focus on getting the cost of health care down.
90:11:00	If the president were to be reelected you're going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare.
90:17:00	You'll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage. You'll have hospital and
90:21:00	providers that'll no longer accept Medicare patients.
90:24:00	I'll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.
90:28:00	And finally, military. The president's reelected you'll see dramatic cuts to our military.
90:33:00	The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating.
90:36:00	I will not cut our commitment to our military. I will keep America strong and get America's
90:42:00	middle class working again.
90:43:00	Thank you, Jim.
90:44:00	LEHRER: Thank you, Governor.
90:45:00	Thank you, Mr. President.
90:46:00	The next debate will be the vice presidential event on Thursday, October 11th at Centre
90:52:00	College in Danville, Kentucky. For now, from the University of Denver, I'm Jim Lehrer.
90:57:00	Thank you, and good night.
